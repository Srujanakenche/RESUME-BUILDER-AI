❌ **DON'T:**
- Expect AI to work on empty resume
- Copy AI output without reviewing
- Use AI for highly specialized/unique roles
- Forget to add your specific achievements

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"AI is loading"** → Wait 20-30 seconds (first use)  
**"Add data first"** → Need experience/education/skills  
**Generic output** → Add more specific details  
**Wrong suggestions** → Delete and add manually

---

**💡 Pro Tip:** Best workflow is:
1. Add basic info manually
2. Use AI to enhance/expand
3. Customize with your unique details
4. Final review for accuracy
